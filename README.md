This repository contains a Python project for predicting scores using machine learning models. It supports preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment of predictive models for tasks such as performance evaluation, academic score forecasting, or game score prediction.

## 🚀 Introduction
This project builds and trains machine learning models to predict scores based on input features. It is highly customizable, allowing you to:

Analyze input datasets.
Preprocess data to handle missing values, scaling, and encoding.
Train models using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
Evaluate predictions using standard metrics like RMSE, MAE, or R².
## ✨ Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scaling, and one-hot encoding.
Customizable Models: Supports regression and tree-based algorithms.
Automated Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid or Random Search for optimization.
Visualization: Includes tools for data analysis and model evaluation.
Deployment Ready: Export models for production use.

## 📊 Data
Input: CSV files with features such as feature_1, feature_2, ..., feature_n.
Output: Target variable representing scores.
Sample dataset is available in data/sample_data.csv.
Data Preprocessing
Handles:
Missing values using mean, median, or custom methods.
Scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler).
Encoding categorical variables.
## 🤖 Model
The project supports multiple machine learning models:

Regression Models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso.
Tree-Based Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.
Neural Networks: Fully connected neural network (TensorFlow or PyTorch).
